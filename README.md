# Just for Fun: Assembler
Dive into the low-level world of assembly language with this repository.

## Makefile
`Makefile` supports compiling programs for both Linux and FreeBSD. By default, make attempts to automatically detect the current operating system using the `uname` command. This command sets the value of the `OS` variable. The value of this variable can also be manually set from the command line using the command `make OS=LINUX` or `make OS=FREEBSD`.

## Kill
`kill` is a simple wrapper for `kill` system call.

## Cat
`cat` is an analogue of the traditional `cat` program for Unix-like operating systems.
